            Skyscrapers springing from rocky outcrops at the edge of Great Slave
            Lake. Sailboats gliding across Back Bay. Float planes soaring in the
            midnight sun. Famous events, including a cultural festival in a snow
            palace and a music festival on a sandy shore. A neighbourhood of
            bright houseboats, all aglow beneath the Aurora. Mansions built next
            to log cabins and teepees; and a whole bunch of friendly, offbeat
            locals, having an extraordinary time in the wildest little city on
            earth.

          The incredible spectacle of the Aurora Borealis, listed among the
          planet's greatest natural wonders, will be unveiled for you on a night
          you'll never forget.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to our prime spot below the auroral oval, Yellowknife is one of
          the best places in the North, and the world, to view the Aurora
          Borealis, also called the Northern Lights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to the most mystical of evenings north of 60Â°. Here you'll
          find the forever magic of the aurora chase - focused on photography, a
          little bit of astronomy. With warm drinks, home baking, and infinite
          patience, we're for all the magic of the Aurora chase, in an
          intimately small group.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dog sledding is still popular in the Northwest Territories, where a
          good team is highly prized and well cared for. Curl up in a
          comfortable cariole - an oak toboggan with canvas sides - traditional
          winter transportation in the North. Meet the dogs - usually a pretty
          friendly bunch - and their delightful puppies. Learn to harness a
          team, and drive your own team with some beginner instruction. It's fun
          and very good exercise. Dog team rides vary from half an hour, to half
          a day or longer.
