          <h6>
            Yellowknife is the capital, largest community, and only city in the
            Northwest Territories, Canada.
          </h6>
          <p>
            It is on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250
            mi) south of the Arctic Circle, on the west side of
            <b>Yellowknife</b> Bay near the outlet of the
            <b>Yellowknife</b>
            River.

          <p>
            <b>Yellowknife</b> and its surrounding water bodies were named after
            a local Dene tribe, who were known as the "<b>Copper Indians</b>" or
            "<b>Yellowknife Indians</b>", today incorporated as the
            <i>Yellowknives Dene First Nation</i>. They traded tools made from
            copper deposits near the Arctic Coast. Its population, which is
            ethnically mixed, was 20,340 per the 2021 Canadian Census. Of the
            eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, five are
            spoken in significant numbers in <b>Yellowknife</b>: Dene Suline,
            Dogrib, South and North Slavey, English, and French. Modern
            Yellowknives members can be found in the adjoining, primarily
            Indigenous communities of NdilÇ« and Dettah.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              <b>Yellowknife</b> is known as the Diamond Capital of North
              America due to its role in the diamond mining industry.
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            The <b>Yellowknife</b> settlement is considered to have been founded
            in 1934, after gold was found in the area, although commercial
            activity in the present-day waterfront area did not begin until
            1936. <b>Yellowknife</b> quickly became the centre of economic
            activity in the NWT, and was named the capital of the Northwest
            Territories in 1967. As gold production began to wane,
            <b>Yellowknife</b> shifted from being a mining town to a centre of
            government services in the 1980s. However, with the discovery of
            diamonds north of the city in 1991, this shift began to reverse. In
            recent years, tourism, transportation, and communications have also
            emerged as significant <b>Yellowknife</b> industries.

          <h6>
            Yellowknife is the capital city of Canada's Northwest Territories
            and has a rich history that dates back thousands of years.
          </h6>
          <p>
            The area was originally inhabited by Indigenous peoples, including
            the Dene and the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, who lived in the
            region for generations. The city's modern history began with the
            discovery of gold in the early 1930s, leading to a gold rush that
            attracted prospectors from all over. The area's booming mining
            industry fueled the growth of <b>Yellowknife</b>, and by 1934, it
            officially became the capital of the Northwest Territories.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the years progressed, <b>Yellowknife</b>'s history diversified
            beyond gold mining. In the mid-20th century, the discovery of
            diamonds in the region sparked a new era of economic growth and
            development. The Ekati Diamond Mine, which opened in 1998, marked
            the first time diamonds were mined in Canada. Subsequently, other
            diamond mines, such as the Diavik Diamond Mine, also contributed to
            the city's economic prosperity and further established
            <b>Yellowknife</b>'s significance in the mining industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Yellowknife</b>'s history is deeply intertwined with the land and
            the Indigenous peoples who have called this area home for centuries.
            Today, the city serves as a cultural melting pot, where ancient
            traditions and modern aspirations converge, making it a unique and
            vibrant place to experience the essence of Canada's northern
            heritage.
